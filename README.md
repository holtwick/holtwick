### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an enthusiastic software developer for web, mobile and desktop applications based in MÃ¼lheim an der Ruhr, Germany. Currently I create and distribute free and commercial applications. Previously I have worked for large companies like [Evernote](https://evernote.com) and [Cellular](https://www.cellular.de).

My goal is to develop appealing applications for communication and knowledge storage while creating the best possible privacy solution. My many years of experience in developing software products for large companies with a broad audience helps me to achieve this goal.
