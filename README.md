I am an enthusiastic software developer for web, mobile and desktop applications based in Germany. Currently I create and distribute free and commercial applications. Previously I have worked for large companies like [Evernote](https://evernote.com) and [Cellular](https://www.cellular.de).

My goal is to develop appealing applications for communication and knowledge storage while creating the best possible privacy solution.
